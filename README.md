# client-management-dashboard

A dashboard that will provide the users of a web application a way to manage each of their clients. The user will be a damage restoration contractor who needs to be able to track client details such as name, policy number, address, email, carrier, type of loss, estimate value and be provided with a way to add additional fields to their dashboard to meet their needs. From there they will be able to click on a clients details and be taken to a screen that provides all of the relavent information they need. Each project will have job site photos that can be stored in the application. The job site photos will be parsed and analyzed by leveraging AI to detect any of the damage at the property as well as recomendations for needed repairs. There will be 1 overall analysis preformed on the images that are being uploaded, first classifying each by the room type and then noting if there exists any damage within the room.
